# Project-Thyroid-Cancer-Recurrence

## Dataset 
The data used in this project comes from the [UCI Machine Learning Repository](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/dataset/915/differentiated+thyroid+cancer+recurrence).

The dataset contains clinical and pathological features related to differentiated thyroid cancer and whether the patient experienced recurrence.

The raw data is not included in this repository. You can download it manually and rename it Thyroid_Diff.csv.


## Project goals

- Explore and preprocess the dataset  
- Train models to predict cancer recurrence  
- Evaluate performance

## Repository structure
- notebook.ipynb -- Jupyter notebook containing all data analysis and model training
- report.pdf -- Final report summarizing methodology and results
- README.md -- Project description
- requirements.txt -- Libraries used

## How to run

You can reproduce the notebook by installing the dependencies and running all cells.

bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
jupyter notebook notebook.ipynb
